=== VITE DEV SERVER OUTPUT ===
Date: $(Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss")

NOTE: To capture actual Vite output, run manually:
  npm run dev

Expected output format:
  VITE v5.x.x  ready in XXX ms
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose

The dev server runs continuously, so output capture requires:
1. Running 'npm run dev' in a terminal
2. Waiting for server to start (usually 2-5 seconds)
3. Capturing first 200 lines of output

=== STATIC SCAN RESULTS ===

Based on codebase analysis:

1. useEffect Hooks Scanned: 132 total
   - Most have proper dependency arrays
   - Some navigate() calls inside onSnapshot callbacks lack mounted guards

2. navigate() Calls Scanned: 231 total
   - Most are in event handlers (safe)
   - Some in onSnapshot callbacks need mounted guards
   - Auth.jsx has proper guards (didRedirectRef)

3. onSnapshot/onAuthStateChanged Scanned: 146 total
   - Most have cleanup functions
   - Critical issue: ConstructorProjectDetails.jsx:180 - fallback onSnapshot has no cleanup
   - Multiple files have fallback onSnapshot that may not be cleaned up properly

=== CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND ===

1. Memory Leak: src/pages/constructor/ConstructorProjectDetails.jsx:180
   - Fallback onSnapshot inside error handler has no cleanup
   - This will cause memory leaks if error occurs

2. Potential Memory Leaks: Multiple files
   - Fallback onSnapshot listeners may not be properly cleaned up
   - Files affected: RenovatorProjectDetails, AdminPanel, MyAccount, etc.

3. Navigate Guards: Multiple files
   - navigate() called inside onSnapshot callbacks without mounted guards
   - Could cause navigation after component unmount

=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===

1. Add mounted guards to all onSnapshot callbacks that call navigate()
2. Ensure all fallback onSnapshot calls are stored in refs and cleaned up
3. Review all useEffect hooks for proper dependency arrays
4. Add cleanup functions for all onSnapshot listeners including fallbacks
