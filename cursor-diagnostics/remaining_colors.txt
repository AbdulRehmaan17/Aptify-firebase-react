Remaining Color Classes Check
==============================

After comprehensive theme migration, the following remaining color classes were found:

1. src/pages/Rental/ViewRental.jsx
   - Line 237: bg-green-100 text-green-600 (FIXED - now uses bg-primary/20 text-primary)

2. src/components/chat/MessageBox.jsx
   - Line 362: text-blue-300 (FIXED - now uses text-primary/70)

STATUS: All color classes have been migrated to the new theme.
Only red (error) and gray (neutral) classes remain, which is intentional.

To verify, run:
grep -R "text-green-\|bg-green-\|text-blue-\|bg-blue-\|text-yellow-\|bg-yellow-" src

Expected: No results (or only in comments/documentation)
