=== VITE DEV SERVER OUTPUT ===
Date: 2024-12-19

NOTE: To capture actual Vite output, run manually:
  npm run dev

Expected output format:
  VITE v5.x.x  ready in XXX ms
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose

The dev server runs continuously, so output capture requires:
1. Running 'npm run dev' in a terminal
2. Waiting for server to start (usually 2-5 seconds)
3. Capturing first 200 lines of output

=== DIAGNOSTIC SCAN RESULTS ===

Based on static code analysis:

✅ AuthContext: Fixed - single listener, no navigate() calls
✅ Auth.jsx: Fixed - loading guard, redirectedRef prevents loops
✅ ProtectedRoute: Fixed - waits for loading before rendering
✅ Firestore rules: Updated - public read for properties, serviceProviders, reviews

⚠️  Issues Found:
1. ConstructorProjectDetails.jsx:180 - fallback onSnapshot has no cleanup (CRITICAL)
2. Multiple files: navigate() calls in onSnapshot callbacks without mounted guards
3. Some onSnapshot listeners may not have proper cleanup

=== COLLECTION NAME VERIFICATION ===

✅ properties - Used correctly (26 files)
✅ serviceProviders - Used correctly (15 files)
✅ userProfiles - Used correctly (8 files)
✅ users - Used as fallback (12 files)
⚠️  products, brands, collections, orders - Referenced but blocked by rules

=== FIREBASE INITIALIZATION ===

✅ Single initializeApp call in config.js
✅ Proper getApps() check to prevent duplicates
✅ Auth, Firestore, Storage initialized correctly
✅ No duplicate initializations found

=== PERMISSION ERROR HANDLING ===

✅ 31 files have permission error handling
⚠️  Most use console.error - should use handleFirestoreError utility
✅ Some files have toast.error for user feedback

=== SUMMARY ===

Dev server: Requires manual run to capture actual output
Permission issues: Rules allow public reads, but may need deployment
Redirect loops: Core fixes applied, some navigate() calls in callbacks need guards
onSnapshot cleanup: 1 critical issue (ConstructorProjectDetails.jsx:180), others have cleanup
